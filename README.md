# OpenCV Tutorial programs

This repository consists of ordered and commented OpenCV tutorial program files (Along with the OpenCV data images/videos) which I used for my own practice. I recommend viewing these in an IDE like PyCharm so that all the parameters of the different OpenCV functions are shown properly and for the general layout of the file (which includes a lot of comments).
